[Design such that there are hints of their true natures, but it isn't immediately obvious what they are] PS they should all be hot/cute

1. Dragon(chinese inspired) in human from who comes from a prestigious family, dresses elegant and refined. Androgynous and a member of the art club, because family wants them to learn all things "classy", very traditional family. Secretly a mangaka, very polular and known for making BL manga, goes by a pen name.

2. Pale, tall, handsome, scary, eyebags, ghostly looking person(maybe with a ominous looking coat/cloak). They are a necromancer by (family)trade and a part of the gardening club, can summon ghosts, talks in an intimidating/threatening tone

3. Cute femboy vampire roommate. Cheery and dresses cutely, loves food and is the sole member of the "food club". They make snacks for everyone and go to all the clubs and deliver the snacks, they also review restaurants and write a column in school newspaper.

4. Hot Incubus but is actually a dense mf. Talks flirty but gets zero bitches, he just talks that way because his family are Incubi/Succubi. He just loves video games so created the game club for all his shy friends, and talks to a lot of people, always flirty but he is just genuinely nice and wholesome. We end up having to confess to this guy because he is one DENSE mf. Often tired because he forgot that he needs to draw energy from sex.

5. Goddess, who is trying to disguise/blend herself into human society, is in a situationship with a demon god, who is also trying to blend himself into the human society. They thought they liked each other because of their common situation but after getting togetehr they realized that they have too different goals, personalities and ambitions. A war god but there is peace now, and she wants to get away from it. Is a member of the drama club, usually the lead actress and deosn't actually get along with her "partner" and they often have spats. She dresses regally, looks very commanding and has a strong personality. Looks like in control (Reference Nadia from The Arcana)

6. The (ice demon)demon god who is in the situationship, dresses simple but there are hints of their godhood in their outfit. He looks and acts very cool/passive and wants to seem chill, but he is inreality doing do to not seem evil like a demon, and cares a lot.

7. Kitsune/fox spirit type character, the director of the drama club. Likes to gossip/cause mischief but actually is kind and uses gossip to test people's character as they judge auditions. Seems like they wanan cause trouble but actually wants people to get along and tugs people to get them to do something to pacth up any problems
